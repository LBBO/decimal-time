      Several different efforts to switch to decimal time were made in France
      throughout history. The most notable of which, however, was during the
      French Revolution. As part of a larger attempt at decimalisation
      (including switching to the metric system), France adopted decimal time on
      22 September 1794. Its use was mandatory until 7 April 1795.

      During that time, clocks were produced with both decimal and standard
      time, allowing for an easier conversion period. However, decimal time
      never caught on. In addition to decimalizing time, France also started
      dividing months into three <em>d√©cades </em> of 10 days each. This change,
      however wasn't abolished until 1805.

      Chinese use of decimal time started by the 1st millennium BC. It was used
      alongside the standard time system and slightly differed from the system
      that was later adopted in France and that is explained on this site.
      Instead of dividing the day into 10 units of time, the Chinese divided it
      into 100 units called <em>ke</em>. However, this was changed from time to
      time. For example, from 5 to 3 BC, days were divided into 120 <em>ke</em>.
